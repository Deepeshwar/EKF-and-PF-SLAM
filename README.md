# EKF-and-PF-SLAM
The mapping and localization problem, called Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is defined as the process of concurrently building a map of the environment while using this map to obtain improved estimates of the robotâ€™s location.
The SLAM algorithm begins with the mobile robot in unknown location, with no a priori knowledge of the map. The robot then uses a sensor to model the visible environment and simultaneously computes an estimate of its own position. Continuing in motion, the mobile robot eventually builds a model of the environment which is useful for navigation.
So, here is the attempt to solve the problem of SLAM using the Extended Kalman Filter approach and Particle Filter approach.
